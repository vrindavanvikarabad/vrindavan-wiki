# What Makes Vrindavan Different

## Not a Resort

Vrindavan is fundamentally different from commercial resorts and getaway destinations. Here's what sets us apart:

### Consciousness over Comfort

In most resorts, comfort is often equated with excess — food wasted, electricity left running, resources overused without thought.

At Vrindavan, **comfort coexists with consciousness**. Visitors are invited to:

- Live simply and mindfully
- Be aware of resource consumption  
- Feel connected to the space around them
- Experience true comfort through inner peace

### Silence over Noise
