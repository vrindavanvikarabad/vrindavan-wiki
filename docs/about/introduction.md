# Introduction to Vrindavan

## Our Story

Amidst the rush and noise of modern life, Vrindavan offers a space of stillness — a place where people can pause, breathe, and rediscover what it means to learn and live meaningfully.

Spread across **3.75 acres** in Anantagiri Palle village, about 70 kilometers from Hyderabad in Vikarabad district, Vrindavan is coincidentally located at Anatagiripalle (Anantagiri Hills). This sacred place lies near Anantagiri Padmanabha Swamy Temple and Bugga Ramalingeshwara Swamy Temple, amidst hills, near the starting point of Muchukunda River (a major tributary of Krishna River, commonly known as Musi).

## A Collective Vision

Vrindavan is not a resort, not a commercial getaway. It is a collective effort of people from different walks of life with a shared vision who came together with a common purpose. This space is not driven by sectarian ideologies but by a universal approach to learning and growth.

!!! quote "Our Mission"
    "To create a space that nurtures silence, focus, and learning — in any form that benefits humanity."

Each partner contributed not merely funds but personal time, energy, and heart. As they describe it:

> "We did not choose this project; it chose us."

Coincidentally, the space's north-east alignment follows Vastu Shastra principles, known to be auspicious. The space serves multiple purposes including workshops, retreats, work meetings, knowledge sharing, and brainstorming sessions.
