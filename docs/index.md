## Welcome to Vrindavan

Amidst the rush and noise of modern life, Vrindavan offers a space of stillness — a place where people can pause, breathe, and rediscover what it means to learn and live meaningfully.

Spread across **3.5 acres** in Anantagiri Palle village, about 70 kilometers from Hyderabad, Vrindavan is located at Anantagiri Hills — a sacred place near Anantagiri Padmanabha Swamy Temple and Bugga Ramalingeshwara Swamy Temple. Nestled amidst the hills and close to the origin of the Muchukunda River (a major tributary of the Krishna River, commonly known as the Musi), Vrindavan is a collective effort shaped by people from diverse walks of life who share a common vision. In many ways, the place itself drew us in, as if inviting this community to take root here. Today, Vrindavan hosts workshops, day visits, work meetings, and knowledge-sharing sessions, with modest plans for solar power and a small gaushala in the future. Coincidentally, the land’s natural north-east orientation follows Vastu Shastra principles, adding to its sense of harmony and purpose.
