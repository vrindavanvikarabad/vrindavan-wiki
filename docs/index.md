## Welcome to Vrindavan

Amidst the rush and noise of modern life, Vrindavan offers a space of stillness — a place where people can pause, breathe, and rediscover what it means to learn and live meaningfully.

Spread across **3.5 acres** in Anantagiri Palle village, about 70 kilometers from Hyderabad, Vrindavan is coincidentally located at Anantagiri Hills — a sacred place near Anantagiri Padmanabha Swamy Temple and Bugga Ramalingeshwara Swamy Temple. Amidst hills, near the starting point of Muchukunda River (a major tributary of Krishna River, commonly known as Musi), this space chose us for a collective vision of people from different walks of life with a shared purpose.
