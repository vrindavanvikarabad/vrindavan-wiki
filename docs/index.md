## Welcome to Vrindavan

Amidst the rush and noise of modern life, Vrindavan offers a space of stillness — a place where people can pause, breathe, and rediscover what it means to learn and live meaningfully.

Spread across **3.75 acres** in Anantagiri Palle village, about 70 kilometers from Hyderabad, Vrindavan is a collective effort of thirteen partners who came together with a shared vision:
