# Botanical Collection

## A Living Heritage

Vrindavan is home to a living botanical treasure — a collection of **over 100 species** of trees and plants that celebrate the biodiversity of India. Each plant has been chosen with care — some for their spiritual or medicinal significance, some for their shade and beauty, and others to preserve native varieties that are fast disappearing from urban landscapes.
